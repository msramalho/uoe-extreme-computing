Calculate the average maximum and minimum runtime duration for all titles per movie genre.

Note that a title can have more than one genre, thus it should be considered for all of them. 

The results should be kept in minutes and the average value should be rounded to 2 decimal places (e.g. 25.30). Lastly, titles with 0 runtime duration are valid and should be accounted for in your solution. 

```python
[avg runtime:float|max runtime:int|min runtime:int|genre:str]
```
